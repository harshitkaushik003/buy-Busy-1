# Introduction
Buy Busy is an e-commerce app which has a collection of books that we can add to cart and order

# Authentication method
This app uses firebase authentication
Benefits of using it over manual authentication are:
1. The passwords are safe with firebase. The programmers of the manager of the database won't have acess to it which they would have in   case of manual authentication
2. Writing unnecessary code can be avoided. Firebase already has the functions required for authentication

# Structure of the app
